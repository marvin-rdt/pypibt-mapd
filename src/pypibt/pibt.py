    """Priority Inheritance with Backtracking algorithm for MAPF.

    PIBT is an iterative algorithm that computes collision-free paths for
    multiple agents quickly, even with hundreds of agents or more. It uses
    priority inheritance and backtracking to resolve conflicts efficiently.

    The algorithm is sub-optimal but provides acceptable solutions almost
    immediately. It maintains distance tables for each agent to their goal
    and uses these for informed decision making. Priorities are dynamically
    updated based on progress toward goals.

    Completeness Guarantee:
        All agents are guaranteed to reach their destinations within a finite
        time when all pairs of adjacent vertices belong to a simple cycle 
        (i.e., biconnected). This property holds regardless of the number 
        of agents.

    Attributes:
        grid: 2D boolean array where True indicates free space.
        starts: Initial positions of all agents.
        goals: Goal positions of all agents.
        N: Number of agents.
        dist_tables: Distance tables for each agent to their goal.
        NIL: Sentinel value representing unassigned agent.
        NIL_COORD: Sentinel value representing unassigned coordinate.
        occupied_now: Current occupation status of each grid cell.
        occupied_nxt: Next timestep occupation status of each grid cell.
        rng: Random number generator for tie-breaking.

    Example:
        >>> grid = get_grid("map.map")
        >>> starts, goals = get_scenario("scenario.scen", N=100)
        >>> pibt = PIBT(grid, starts, goals, seed=42)
        >>> solution = pibt.run(max_timestep=1000)
        >>> print(f"Solution length: {len(solution)}")
