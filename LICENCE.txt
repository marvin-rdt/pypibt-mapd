ATTRIBUTION

This software combines code from two separate repositories by Keisuke Okumura:

1. pypibt - Python implementation of PIBT for MAPF (2023)
   Copyright (c) 2023 Keisuke Okumura
   https://github.com/Kei18/pypibt
   Used: MAPF solver code (pibt.py, mapf_utils.py, dist_table.py) - UNCHANGED
   
2. pibt2 - C++ implementation of PIBT for MAPF and MAPD (2021)
   Copyright (c) 2021 Keisuke Okumura
   https://github.com/Kei18/pibt2
   Used: MAPD algorithm translated from C++ to Python (mapd.py, mapd_utils.py)

3. PIBT Algorithm Research Paper:
   Okumura, K., Machida, M., Défago, X., & Tamura, Y. (2022).
   "Priority Inheritance with Backtracking for Iterative Multi-agent Path Finding"
   Artificial Intelligence Journal.
   https://kei18.github.io/pibt2/

CONTRIBUTIONS BY THIS REPOSITORY (2025):
- Python translation of MAPD from C++ (pibt2) to Python
- Unified CLI interface for both MAPF and MAPD modes
- Extended documentation, examples, and Jupyter notebooks
- Maintainer: Marvin Rüdt
